# InfView

InfView is a visualization tool for relational data models. It accepts a
JSON-based schema description, and is able to read and display data from either a
custom file-based data source, or an SQL database. It allows basic CRUD
functionality on the data, alongside advanced search, sorting and displaying
related rows.
